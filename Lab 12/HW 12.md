    Attaching package: 'dplyr'

    The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':

        filter, lag

    The following objects are masked from 'package:base':

        intersect, setdiff, setequal, union

``` r
median_expression <- data %>%
  group_by(geno) %>%
  summarise(median_exp = median(exp, na.rm = TRUE))

print(sample_sizes)
```


    A/A A/G G/G 
    108 233 121 

``` r
print(median_expression)
```

    # A tibble: 3 Ã— 2
      geno  median_exp
      <chr>      <dbl>
    1 A/A         31.2
    2 A/G         25.1
    3 G/G         20.1

``` r
boxplot(data$exp~data$geno)
```

![](HW-12_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)

AA expression is much more than GG expression. The SNP affects the
expression of ORMDL3 with A express much more than G.
