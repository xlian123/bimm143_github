>Q13: Read this file into R and determine the sample size for each genotype and their corresponding median expression levels for each of these genotypes.

```{r}
data <- read.table("rs8067378_ENSG00000172057.6.txt", header = TRUE)
```

```{r}
summary (data)
```

```{r}
sample_sizes <- table(data$geno)

library(dplyr)
median_expression <- data %>%
  group_by(geno) %>%
  summarise(median_exp = median(exp, na.rm = TRUE))

print(sample_sizes)
print(median_expression)

```

>Q14: Generate a boxplot with a box per genotype, what could you infer from the relative expression value between A/A and G/G displayed in this plot? Does the SNP effect the expression of ORMDL3?

```{r}
boxplot(data$exp~data$geno)
```

AA expression is much more than GG expression. The SNP affects the expression of ORMDL3 with A express much more than G.
